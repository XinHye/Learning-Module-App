Increment & Decrement Operators

- C has two special operators for incrementing or decrementing a variable by 1:
  -> ++ (increment)
  -> -- (decrement)

Increment:
Instead of writing
	count = count + 1;

We can more concisely write
	count++;     //Postfix form of the increment operator
	
	OR

	++count;    //Prefix form of the increment operator

Decrement: 
Instead of writing
	count = count - 1;

We can more concisely write
	count--;     //Postfix form of the decrement operator
	
	OR

	--count;    //Prefix form of the decrement operator

<Example 1>
	int count = 3;
	printf("%d", count++);     //output: count = 3;
	printf("%d", count);         //output: count = 4;

<Example 2> 
	int count = 3;
	printf("%d", ++count);     //output: count = 4;
	printf("%d", count);         //output: count = 4;
